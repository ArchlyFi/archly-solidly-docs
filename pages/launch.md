# Launch Details

Archly launched on Friday, November 25, 2022.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  As with any launch, we'd like to warn our users about the potential limitations
  of the first release. At launch, our dApp will render best in
  **desktop environments**.
  
  If at any point you require assistance, please join our
  [Telegram](https://t.me/ArchlyFinance), where our community and we will be
  happy to help you!
</Callout>

## Getting Ready

Archly Finance operates exclusively on the Telos EVM network.

If you are unfamiliar with Telos or the Telos EVM, you can find a lot of resources
about the network, its ecosystem, and its mission on the Telos website
https://www.telos.net

To set up your wallet, please go to https://chainlist.org and search for
_Telos_. You can use the _Connect Wallet_ button to automatically configure
your default wallet to use Telos. Use the _arrow down_ to expand for more
configuration options.

<Callout  emoji="🪂">
  Be sure to learn about the [Telos
  Ignite](https://ignite.telos.net) and [Telos Fuel](https://fuel.telos.net) to see if you qualify for a grant or TLOS incentives!
</Callout>

## Bridging

New Telos EVM users who want to participate in Archly should make sure they
have `$TLOS` on the Telos EVM in order to be able to pay for transaction/gas fees.

Bridging to the Telos EVM is possible at the following: 

* Multichain: https://multichain.org/
* Elk Finance: https://elk.finance/

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Some bridging services can take up to 20-30 minutes to complete a transfer of
